# htmlutil

> coverage: 100%

Package htmlutil implements a wrapper for Golang's html5 tokeniser / parser implementation, making it much easier to
find and extract information, aiming to be powerful and intuitive while remaining a minimal and logical extension.

[See the godoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/joeycumines/go-htmlutil)

As of v1.0.0 the API is stable and used in multiple (personal) projects. Unless I run into a compelling use case I am declaring this feature complete. It would be nice to add some examples though, maybe later.
